/*

Define a Trivia class that contains information about a single 
trivia question. The question and answer should be defined as 
instance variables of type String. Create accessor and mutator 
methods. In your main method, create two trivia objects with 
questions and answers of your choice. Then for each Trivia 
object, have your program ask the question, input an answer, 
compare the typed answer to the actual to the actual answer, 
and output if the userâ€™s answer was correct or incorrect.
